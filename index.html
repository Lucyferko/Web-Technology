<!-- COMPATIBILITY REPORT:
We used Google Chrome and Safari, both tested on MacOS, to assess the compatibility of the website.
We did not notice any significant differences in the way the content and style markup was displayed 
across these platform. Additionally, we used the responsive design mode in Safari to design the 
breakpoints for smaller screens. 
ADDED:
For testing we used Chrome, as it is the most popular borwser and Firefox as the most popular non-chormium based browser, 
which means there might be extra issues with compatibility to adress. The style is simple and thus easily translatable across browsers. 
The print style was made with toner consideration while keeping the identity of the website intact.
The sizing is responsive to screen size & scale. Also tested for different screen ratios. The style and compatibility is consistent from what we saw in testing.
ADDED: 
Changed texts & images & links to reflect the difference in assignemnts from last year
